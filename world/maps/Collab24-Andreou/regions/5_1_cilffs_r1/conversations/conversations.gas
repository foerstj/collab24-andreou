I believe that getting rid of their leader will make them less aggressive for a while, while they will be licking their wounds. You seem a fearsome warrior. If you manage to clear that cave of theirs we will be able to go on our way, much to the relief of our neighboring hermit here. He even might reward you for such a deed himself.";
